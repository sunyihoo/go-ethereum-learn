package trie

// tracer tracks the changes of trie nodes. During the trie operations,
// some nodes can be deleted from the trie, while these deleted nodes
// won't be captured by trie.Hasher or trie.Committer. Thus, these deleted
// nodes won't be removed from the disk at all. Tracer is an auxiliary tool
// used to track all insert and delete operations of trie and capture all
// deleted nodes eventually.
//
// The changed nodes can be mainly divided into two categories: the leaf
// node and intermediate node. The former is inserted/deleted by callers
// while the latter is inserted/deleted in order to follow the rule of trie.
// This tool can track all of them no matter the node is embedded in its
// parent or not, but valueNode is never tracked.
//
// Besides, it's also used for recording the original value of the nodes
// when they are resolved from the disk. The pre-value of the nodes will
// be used to construct trie history in the future.
//
// Note tracer is not thread-safe, callers should be responsible for handling
// the concurrency issues by themselves.
